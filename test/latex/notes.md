# Notes

## Things to cover

- contemporary quantum (NISQ)
- theorhetical prospects of quantum advantage
- classical machine learning
  - convolution / pooling
  - limitations solved by quantum
  - growing neural networks
- data encoding
  - different encoding methods
    - amplitude encoding (low width, high depth)
  - state preparation in QML
  - C2Q
  - low-frequency C2Q-encoding (depth-conscious)
- classical haar transform
- QHT
  - qht as convolution/pooling
  - qht in quantum via amplitude encoding (zero-depth)
- QML
  - variational algorithms
  - what advantage is given by using classical computers in optimization, i.e. quantum can only provide feature map/space
- QCNN
  - lots of related work in this field
  - don't factor in dimensionality

- All ML algorithms can be broken into matrix algebra / linear algebra with nonlinear componenets. All QC circuits are unitary matrix operations, use restless measurement / mid circuit measurement to introduce nonlinear elements (pooling)
